# rustyshare - It compiles!

[verse]

So i wanted to learn Rust and though it might be a _good_ idea to implement RetroShare in Rust as an exercise.
Some parts might still look "c like" and some design pattern might be stupid or "anti Rust".

## Update 2 - _async/await and TLV_:
  * finally managed to get TLV wroking with serde. Wasn't that hard after
  * all - once you know how to do it.
  ** it's quite easy now, you only have to deal with::
  *** `Tlv` generic TLV type with fixed length content (e.g. a struct)
  *** `Tlv2` generic TLV type with variable length content (e.g. a vector)
  *** `TlvSet` generic TLV set
  *** `TlvMap` generic TLV map
  *** `TlvMapWithPair` generic TLV map that wraps both `Key` and `Value` in a `TlvGenericPairRef` ...
  *** also `TlvIpAddress` requires extra work since the same packet/tag can contain a IPv4 or IPv6 TlvIpAddress and you have to check the inner tag to find out
  *** also `TlvSecurityKeySet` requires extra work since private and public keys are the same and you have to check the key flags after serializing it
  * everything blocking is now async (network, queues) using tokio
  * added support for sqlite(-cipher) (very basic)
  * added support for the REST api (using actix), not much is implemented yet
  ** also the RsNewWebUi doesn't use `content-type` so actix will complain (complain == doesn't do anything)
  *** can be fixed in RsNewWebUi by adding `headers['Content-type'] = 'application/json';` in https://github.com/RetroShare/RSNewWebUI/blob/master/webui-src/app/rswebui.js#L30[rswebui]
  * removed any manual serialization (looking at you `serial_stuff.rs`)
  * stubbed out `chat` service
  ** currently all available lobbies are joined and both events and messages are logged

## Update 1 - _Fast as a turtle_:
  * Added/factored out `retroshare_compat` lib for handling wire format and similar.
  * Implemented discovery to receive ip updates.
  * Implemented turtle (currently only forwards generic tunnels).
  * Slice format is used whenever sending.

### What it can do:
  * use (load and decrypt) existing (PGP) key ring and locations
  * parses some aspects from peers.cfg
  * parses general.cfg (but doesn't care about its content)
  * connect to peers (tcp only)
  * understand "new" slice format
  * listens on the location's port for incoming connections;;
  ** currently broken for unknown reasons:
    _tls_post_process_client_hello:no shared cipher_ which is a lie!
  * supports the following services:
  ** *bwctrl*: Not sure if useful, make you appear in peers stats window.
  ** *discovery*: Partly implemented to get up to date ip information from your friends.
  ** *heartbeat*: Comparable to rtt just without time stamps
  ** *rtt*: Simple ping/pong protocol
  ** *service_info*: Tell peers which services are available (kind of required for anything)
  ** *status*: Tell peers that we are online (makes you appear green on their end)
  ** *turtle*: Able to forward (generic) tunnel data.

### What it can't do:
  * basically everything else
  * peers are not verified (!!)
  * nothing is written/stored

### What is planned next? _(tentative)_:
  * [.line-through]##Find a painless way to support RS's TLV / sane serialization mixture.##
  * [.line-through]##try out nom for TLV##
  * consider (basic) REST api support.
  * [.line-through]##async support, probably not gonna happen soon##
  * turtle fast path, directly sending data to the target peer, skipping
  the core.
  * experiment with rustls instead of openssl

## What else is there?
  * There is https://xeres.io/[Xeres]! It's a RetroShare client written in Java.
